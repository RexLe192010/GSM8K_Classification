We can solve this problem using either arithmetic or equations.\nApproach A: We can use arithmetic to compute the total amount of apples needed for 2 weeks (i.e., 14 days), which is equal to 7 apples (half an apple per day for Irene and her dog). Since a small apple weighs about 1/4 of a pound, 7 apples weigh 7/4 pounds, which is equal to 1.75 pounds. Given that apples cost $2.00 a pound, the total cost of the apples needed for 2 weeks is 1.75 x $2.00 = $3.50.\nApproach B: We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the amount of apples Irene needs to buy and the number of days they need to last. Let x be the total amount of apples needed for 2 weeks. Then, we can write the equation 0.5x = (1/4) x 14, which represents the fact that Irene shares half of a small apple with her dog every day, and a small apple weighs about 1/4 of a pound.

The number of burgers can be calculated by dividing the total number of guests by the average number of burgers per guest. Since half of the guests want 2 burgers and the other half wants 1 burger each, the average number of burgers per guest can be calculated as (0.5 x 2) + (0.5 x 1) = 1.5 burgers per guest. Therefore, the total number of burgers needed is 1.5 x 30 = 45 burgers. The total cooking time for each burger is 4 minutes on each side, so the total cooking time for one burger is 8 minutes.

We can start by using the given information to set up an equation to represent the total amount collected:\n\n400x + 200y = 16,000\n\nwhere x is the price of an adult ticket and y is the price of a child's ticket. We also know that the price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket, so we can use this relationship to express x in terms of y:\n\nx = 2y\n\nSubstituting this expression into the first equation, we get:\n\n400(2y) + 200y = 16,000\n\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\n\n1000y = 16,000\n\ny = 16\n\nSo the price of a child's ticket is $16. We can then use the relationship between x and y to find the price of an adult ticket:\n\nx = 2y = 2(16) = $32\n\nTherefore, the price of an adult ticket is $32. \n\n#### A", "result": "A", "time_cost": 4.322376728057861}, "2bc908543c02f64c4620c646e7f5e3f2": {"raw_response": "Thinking:\nThis problem involves a direct calculation to find the number of charcoal drawings, based on the information provided about the total number of drawings and the number of drawings made with colored pencils and blending markers.
